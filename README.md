# Social Media ChatBot

The AddictionAware Chatbot is a digital sanctuary crafted with React and powered by the Groq API, designed to stand at the intersection of modern technology and timeless therapeutic wisdom. This AI-driven companion is more than just a chatbot — it’s a confidant, a guide, and a gentle nudge toward reclaiming control over social media usage.

Built with a keen eye on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, it offers interactive conversations that challenge addictive thought patterns and encourage users to reflect on their digital habits. The chatbot weaves mindful engagement prompts into everyday interactions, helping users to pause, breathe, and consciously decide how to spend their screen time.

Equipped with usage tracking, the chatbot keeps a watchful eye on social media consumption, translating mindless scrolling into mindful awareness. Through habit-replacement strategies, it suggests healthier alternatives — reading, exercise, or simple breathing exercises — gently guiding users toward balanced digital wellbeing.

With a user-friendly React interface, the chatbot feels like a friend rather than a disciplinarian, offering a safe space to explore the underlying causes of digital dependency. Its integration with Groq’s advanced AI ensures conversations are responsive, empathetic, and grounded in psychological insight.

In a world where screens dominate our attention, the AddictionAware Chatbot dares to ask: “Are you living online, or living life?” By combining the art of conversation with evidence-based strategies, it empowers users to break free from the addictive pull of social media — one mindful step at a time.
